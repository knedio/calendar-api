    Calendar API
</p>
<p>
    I'm using a laravel framework for my calendar.
</p>
<p>
    Commands to setup this project:
    <ul>
        <li>
            php artisan migrate
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I'm using a single-responsibility principle pattern in this project.
</p>
<p>
    This project has also basic PHP Unit Testing.
